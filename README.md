# Project 2

This website is part of my homework for the course Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.
People can use the website to chat with other people. They can create a new channel or join an existing one.
Users don't have to register; simply choosing a username is enough. Other users will see this username too.
When going away and opening the site later again, the username and last channel will be remembered.
It is also possible for a user to delete the messages they have sent themselves.
